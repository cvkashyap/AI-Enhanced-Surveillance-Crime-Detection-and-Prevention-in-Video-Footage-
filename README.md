The AI-Enhanced Surveillance System utilizes advanced deep learning models for real-time crime detection and prevention in video footage. YOLOv8, a cutting-edge object detection model, identifies potentially dangerous objects such as guns and knives by processing video frames at high speed (up to 53 FPS). Detected objects are labeled with bounding boxes and confidence scores. Additionally, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed to classify behaviors based on the movements and interactions of individuals with the detected objects, allowing the system to identify suspicious activities. This integrated approach automates the surveillance process, reducing reliance on human operators and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of crime detection efforts.
